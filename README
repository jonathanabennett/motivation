This program outputs a single, random quote from a list to your commandline. It is meant to be added
to your .bashrc so that the quote appears at the top of each new terminal that you open.

=COMPILING= You can compile this using any C++ compiler. On my Linux system, I am using the
following command

'g++ motivation.cpp -o motivate'

Then, simply add a call to motivate in your .bashrc like this

'~/motivate'

After that, you'll get a new message at the top of each new terminal.

=ADDING MESSAGE= Messages are pulled from a text file called quotes.txt. The program assumes this
file is in the same directory as the executable. 

This file should contain 1 quote per line. 

Blank lines count as "quotes" so do not use blank lines to separate quotes.

Quotes spanning more than 1 line will be split into separate "quotes", so do not use quotes which
are longer than 1 line.
