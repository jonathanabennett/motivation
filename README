This program outputs a single, random quote from a list to your commandline. It is meant to be added
to your .bashrc so that the quote appears at the top of each new terminal that you open.

=COMPILING=
You can compile this using any C++ compiler. On my Linux system, I am using the following command

'g++ motivation.cpp -o motivate'

Then, simply add a call to motivate in your .bashrc like this

'~/motivate'

After that, you'll get a new message at the top of each new terminal.

=ADDING MESSAGE=
Quotes are added to a C++ Vector. Currently, reading from a separate file is not yet supported. I'm
working on that.

To add a new quote/message, simply open up motivation.cpp and add a new "quotes.push_back()" call
like this

'quotes.push_back("New motivational quote.");

You can delete messages by deleting the line.

After you have many any changes you want, you will need to recompile per the directions above until
I get file support build in.
